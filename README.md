# Template project for building a plugin (shared lib) with Conan v2 and CMake

## Intro

This is a template for building a C++ plugin as a
shared-lib/DLL/CFBundle. It uses Conan for dependencies and CMake as
the build generator. It's intended to show best practices for using
modern (as of 2024) cmake, 3.28 or later, and Conan v2.

It uses the new-for-2024 conan-cmake integration, where cmake calls
conan to install the dependencies and then configure the build. A copy
of that integration is included in this repo as
`conan_provider.cmake`.

## Build

To build the plugin, use `./build.sh`. 
This runs `cmake --preset default` to configure, and then
`cmake --build --preset default` to do the build using the
configured build tool (cmake's default is Makefiles).

The configure step invokes `conan` to build/install the dependencies.
In this template, I've used the `spdlog` logging framework based on
`fmt` as a sample dependency, just to show how the system works.

## Notes

* The way the CMake presets are defined, you must use `cmake` as the driver. 
  Manually doing `conan install .` will cause duplicate CMake presets to be generated.
  
  * I would like to make it possible to build as
    `conan install . && cmake --preset <something>` 
    but don't know how to do that.

* To do a clean build, remove the `build` directory, and `CMakeUserPresets.json`. 
  If you don't remove the presets file the build will fail 
  because `CMakeUserPresets.json`, which is generated by conan, refers to
  files in `build`. The `build.sh` script will remove that preset file if
  `build` doesn't exist, to prevent that error.
