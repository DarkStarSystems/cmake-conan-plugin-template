# Template project for building a plugin (shared lib) with Conan v2 and CMake

## Intro

This is a template for building a C++ plugin as a
shared-lib/DLL/CFBundle. It uses Conan for dependencies and CMake as
the build generator. It's intended to show best practices for using
modern (as of 2024) cmake, 3.28 or later, and Conan v2.

It uses the new-for-2024 conan-cmake integration, where cmake calls
conan to install the dependencies and then configure the build. A copy
of that integration is included in this repo as
`conan_provider.cmake`.

## Build

To build the plugin, use `./build.sh`. 
This runs `cmake --preset default` to configure, and then
`cmake --build --preset default` to do the build using the
configured build tool (cmake's default is Makefiles).

The configure step invokes `conan` to build/install the dependencies.
In this template, I've used the `spdlog` logging framework based on
`fmt` as a sample dependency, just to show how the system works.

## Notes

* To use a different generator, e.g. "Ninja Multi-Config":
  > [!NOTE]
  > This only works with the conan-cmake integration, i.e. cmake as driver,
  > and only with the default preset. (But you can pass `--config` to specify build type.)
  ```sh
  cmake --preset default -G "Ninja Multi-Config"
  cmake --build --preset default --config Debug
  cmake --build --preset default --config Release
  ```
  (this is in `./build-ninja.sh`)

  > [!CAUTION]
  > I haven't yet found out how to do a manual `conan install` invocation
  > using a multi-config 


* To do a build with a manual `conan install` invocation, do it like this:
  ```sh
  conan install . --build=missing
  cmake --preset conan-release
  cmake --build --preset conan-release
  ```
  and to build in debug mode, do this:
  ```sh
  conan install . -s build_type=Debug --build=missing
  cmake --preset conan-debug
  cmake --build --preset conan-debug
  ```

* To do a clean build, remove the `build` directory, and `CMakeUserPresets.json`. 
  If you don't remove the presets file the build will fail 
  because `CMakeUserPresets.json`, which is generated by conan, refers to
  files in `build`. The `build.sh` script will remove that preset file if
  `build` doesn't exist, to prevent that error.
